just a fun gui what you can use in your game, but you also can use it in a executor to exploit. better you do that not. and something in the gui doesnt work, sorry for that. where working on the v2 btw. i hope you use it for admin things or something...

# place the script in starterplayer > starterplayerscripts
# loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TechFusionStudios404/roblox-meowgui-v1-by-4b3l/main/main.lua", true))()


thats it

thanks for using my script
